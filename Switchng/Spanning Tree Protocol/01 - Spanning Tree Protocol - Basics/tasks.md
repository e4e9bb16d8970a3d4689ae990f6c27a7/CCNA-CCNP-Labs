---

## Technologies covered:
- STP

## Estimated time:
**15 minutes**

## Tasks:

1. Configure topology according to template (topology.png) and predict how will the logical (STP) topology look like and compare it to reality or *solved_topology.png*
	- Keep in mind that in EVE-NG devices with lowest number in name have the lowest MAC address and vice versa
2. Configure STP in such way that logical topology will look like *task_topology.png*
